# Jokarikara - Future Roadmap

"Master the rhythm, time your taps, and build the ultimate shape stack!"

This roadmap outlines the future vision for **Jokarikara**, expanding on its core minimalist stacking mechanics with deeper progression, rhythmic integration, and social features.

## 🎵 Audio & Rhythm

The heartbeat of the game will evolve from simple procedural tones to a full rhythmic experience.

- **Dynamic Soundtrack**: Background music that evolves as you play. Start with a simple bassline, and add percussion, melody, and harmony layers as your stack grows higher.
- **Rhythm Mode**: A special game mode where the active shape's growth and rotation sync perfectly with the beat. Tapping on the beat grants bonus score multipliers.

## 🕹️ Gameplay Variations

New ways to play that challenge different skills.

- **Zen Mode**: Pure relaxation. No fail state—if you miss, the shape just resets without ending the game. Endless undo button available. Focus on creating beautiful, impossible towers.
- **Time Attack**: A race against the clock. You have 60 seconds to stack as many shapes as possible. Perfect placements add time to the clock. High risk, high reward.
- **Boss Mechanics**: Every 10 levels, encounter a "Boss Shape". These are unique challenges—giant shapes, erratically moving blocks, or shape-shifting geometry that requires observation and specific timing to conquer.

## 🏆 Social & Progression

Giving players long-term goals and reasons to compete.

- **Leaderboards**:
  - **Global**: See where you stack up against the world.
  - **Friends**: compete directly with friends for the weekly high score.
- **Skins & Themes**: Unlockable visual styles based on achievements (e.g., "reach Level 50", "Stack 1000 shapes").
  - _Cyberpunk_: Neon glitched aesthetics.
  - _Vaporwave_: Pink/cyan gradients and retro grids.
  - _Nature_: Organic textures and calming earth tones.
- **Achievements**: specific challenges like "Perfect Alignment" (10 perfect drops in a row) or "Speed Demon" (reach level 5 in under 30 seconds).

## 🛠️ Polish & Tech

Continuously improving the look and feel.

- **Haptic Feedback**: On mobile devices, feel the "thud" of a heavy shape landing or the subtle vibration of the heartbeat rhythm.
- **Enhanced Visuals**: Improved particle effects for perfect drops, screen shake for game overs, and smoother transitions between world states.
