# Jokarikara - Gameplay Guide

Welcome to **Jokarikara**, a minimalist shape-stacking challenge. This guide explains the rules, mechanics, and progression of the game.

## 🕹️ Core Objective

The goal is simple: **stack geometric shapes as high as you can.**

Each successful stack increases your score. The game ends the moment a shape is placed even slightly outside the boundaries of the shape below it.

## 🎮 How to Play

1.  **The Starting Shape**: Every game begins with a large base circle in the center of the screen.
2.  **Growth**: A new "Active Shape" will appear at the center and begin to grow automatically from a tiny size.
3.  **The Tap**: You must tap the screen (or click) at the precise moment the active shape is large enough to be challenging, but still **completely contained** within the perimeter of the shape directly beneath it.
4.  **Success**: If the active shape is fully contained, it enters the stack, and a new shape begins to grow.
5.  **Failure**: If any part of the active shape's boundary falls outside the previous shape, the game ends.

## ⚙️ Game Mechanics

### 📏 Automatic Growth

Each shape grows at a unique, randomized speed between **25 and 90 units per second**. Some shapes will require quick reflexes, while others will test your patience.

### 🔄 Rotation

To add to the challenge, shapes rotate as they grow.

- **Dynamic Speed**: The rotation speed starts slow and increases as your score goes up, capped at a maximum difficulty level.
- **Post-Stack Motion**: Even after being placed, shapes in the stack continue to rotate slowly, creating a living, breathing tower.

### 🔍 Dynamic Zoom

As you level up, the camera smoothly zooms in. This keeps the active shapes at a playable size relative to the screen, even as the stack grows narrower and more precise.

### 🎨 Visual Feedback

- **Colors**: The game cycles through a vibrant palette of colors (Blue, Emerald, Amber, Red, Violet, and Pink).
- **Fading**: To maintain clarity and performance, shapes older than 10 layers deep will gradually fade out.

## 📈 Progression & Levels

### 🆙 Leveling Up

For every **5 successful stacks**, you reach a new level. Leveling up is signaled by a distinct audio cue and a camera zoom adjustment.

### 🔷 Shape Unlocks

New levels unlock more complex geometric shapes, increasing the difficulty of containment:

- **Level 1**: Circle, Octagon
- **Level 2**: Pentagon, Hexagon
- **Level 3**: Square
- **Level 4**: Triangle (challenging vertices!)
- **Level 5**: Rectangle

### 🌍 World Mechanics

After completing level 5, you advance to **World 2**, resetting the level counter but introducing new visual and gameplay effects. Each subsequent world adds cumulative mechanics:

| World | Effect                 | Description                                                                    |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1** | Baseline               | No special effects                                                             |
| **2** | 🫁 Breathing           | Stacked shapes subtly pulse in size                                            |
| **3** | 🚀 Accelerating Growth | Active shape grows faster with each stack in a level (1x → 1.25x → 1.5x)       |
| **4** | 🌊 Wave                | Stacked shapes sway horizontally (active shape stays stable for fair gameplay) |
| **5** | 🌈 Color Shift         | Stacked shapes cycle through rainbow hues                                      |
| **6** | 🌑 The Eclipse         | Background turns black; the container shape is invisible and pulses light.     |
| **7** | 🧲 Gravity Drift       | The active shape slowly drifts downward while growing.                         |
| **8** | ↔️ Rotation Inversion  | Stack rotation direction flips by level and during boss levels.                |

> **Note**: Effects are additive. World 5 includes all previous effects: breathing + accelerating growth + wave + color shift.

## 🎵 Dynamic Audio

The game features a procedural audio engine:

- **Stacking**: Each successful placement produces a musical note that rises in pitch as your stack grows.
- **Level Up**: A high-pitched chime reward.
- **Game Over**: A descending "buzz" sound.

## Developer Notes: Extending Gameplay

Gameplay configuration now lives in `src/gameplay/config.ts` and is built with
`GameplayBuilder`. Add new worlds or levels by extending that builder chain.

Example:

```ts
// src/gameplay/config.ts
builder.world(7, (w) =>
  w.name("New World").mechanics({
    breathingEffect: true,
    breathingAmplitude: 0.04,
    breathingSpeed: 2.5,
  }),
);

builder.level(6, { zoom: 16, unlocks: ["star"] });
builder.boss(25, {
  type: "star",
  growthSpeedMultiplier: 2.8,
  rotationSpeedMultiplier: 3.8,
  hueShift: true,
});
```
